Simple Shell Project

This project, created by Samuel Tolossa and Naol Ketema, aims to develop a basic Unix shell from scratch. 
The shell provides the following functionality:

Command Execution: The shell allows users to execute various Unix commands, such as ls, cd, and echo.

Input/Output Redirection: Users can redirect input and output streams, enabling operations like writing command output to a file or reading input from a file.

Piping: The shell supports piping multiple commands together, allowing the output of one command to serve as input to another.

Environment Variables: Users can manipulate environment variables within the shell.

Signal Handling: The shell handles signals, allowing users to terminate processes gracefully using signals like Ctrl+C.

Custom Shell Commands: The project includes the implementation of custom shell commands.

This Unix shell project provides a foundational understanding of how shells work and how they interact with the operating system, enhancing the knowledge and skills of developers Samuel Tolossa and Naol Ketema.
